# Adventures with WebSockets
__Presented By [Giancarlo Gomez](https://github.com/GiancarloGomez)__

Adventures with WebSockets Presentation Code

* Game<br />
This is a game that was inspired by Mark Mandel's presentation on Scalable Realtime Microservices with Kubernetes and gRPC where he showcased a working example of a 2 player Simon game.

## Run using CommandBox
You can easily run the game using CommandBox. Simply clone this repo to your local machine
and go into the ``game`` folder in your Terminal or Command Prompt and run ``box start``.

To use the console to debug the game, make sure to clone the _WebSockets Console App_ and
create an alias to the directory or drop inside the ``game`` folder.

You can create an alias by running the ``server set`` command.

```
server set web.aliases./console = \path\to\console
```
